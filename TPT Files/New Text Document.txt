STOP GIVING BORING WORKSHEETS! Give your students a mission they won’t forget.

The Story: Orbital Station Zeta has suffered a critical system failure. As "Cadets," your students must use their knowledge of equivalent fractions to solve 10 high-stakes puzzles. Each correct answer provides a "Power Code" to be entered into a real interactive web terminal.

Why Teachers Love Logic Labs:

Self-Grading: The web terminal validates codes instantly. No more grading 30 papers!

Zero Login Required: Students just go to the URL and play. No passwords, no hassle.

High Engagement: Custom-coded animations and "Top Secret" sound effects keep students focused.

Hybrid Learning: Combines critical thinking on paper (the PDF) with digital interaction.

Skills Covered:

Identifying equivalent fractions using visual area models.

Finding missing numerators/denominators.

Simplifying fractions to the simplest form.

Equivalent fractions on a number line.

What’s Inside:

The Mission Terminal Link: (Hosted on GitHub Pages for 99.9% uptime).

5 Printable Clue Sheets: The "Dossier" containing 10 math challenges.

Teacher Quick-Start Guide: Set up the whole activity in under 2 minutes.

Answer Key & Success Certificate.

3. Pricing Strategy
Base Price: $6.00

Why? Most TPT escape rooms are $5.00. Because you are a web developer providing a custom-coded experience (not just a Google Form), you can charge a premium. Teachers will pay for the "cool factor" and the fact that it is self-grading.

4. The "Big Three" Visuals (Required Uploads)
Main Cover (1:1 Square): * Text: "Equivalent Fractions SPACE ESCAPE" (Huge bold font).

Sub-text: "Interactive Web Terminal Included."

Visual: A picture of a hand holding a tablet showing your site next to the printed PDF.

The Preview PDF: * This is the most important file. Create a 3-page PDF that shows a blurred version of the clue sheets and a screenshot of the "Mission Successful" screen. Watermark everything so they can't just screenshot it for free.

Video Preview: * Record a 30-second screen capture of you typing a code into your site and the "Warp Drive Active" animation playing. This sells the product faster than any text.
